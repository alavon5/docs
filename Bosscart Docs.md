\#\# Tracking Links  
How do we know what’s working and what’s not?  
We use \*\*UTM\*\* codes.  
To navigate to the tracking link creator \> Select your store tab \> products \> Generate a link as shown below:  
\*\*A Handy Guide to UTM Codes: Know Which of Your Campaigns Really Work\*\*  
UTM stands for Urchin tracking parameters. They’re little pieces of data that we add to our URLs in order to see where different traffic comes from. They were introduced way back with an analytics tool called Urchin, the tool that was bought by Google and evolved into Google Analytics. Somewhere along the way, they became the industry standard for tracking marketing campaigns across tools.  
These days, most analytics tools, marketing apps, marketing automation tools, and CRMs look for these parameters automatically.  
We use three standard parameters.  
\* \*\*UTM Source\*\*: The individual site within that channel. For example, Facebook would be one of the sources within your Social medium for any unpaid links that you post to Facebook. If you’re running a Facebook ad or spending money to promote a link, you’d want to label Facebook as a source within Paid. If you’re building a link for email, define which list that you’re sending the email to.  
   
\* \*\*UTM Medium:\*\* Think of this as a channel. Social, Organic, Paid, Email, Affiliates, are all core marketing channels that include multiple traffic sources.  
   
\* \*\*UTM Campaign:\*\* The specific campaign that you’re running. Feel free to fill this in however it makes sense to you. Names that allow you to easily identify product launches, promotional campaigns, individual emails or posts, etc. are all good.  
   
\> Whenever you put a link on an external site (not your own site), you add these parameters to your URL. Then when traffic lands on your site, you know where the visitor came from and that data appears in all your marketing and analytics tools.  
\#\#\#   
\*\*Tracking campaign builder\*\*  
Once you have created your tracking campaign, you can now copy and paste the url to your preferred off site source.  
Once your link starts to generate traffic you can view all the data in the \*\*Top Sources Tab:\*\*  
Note, source data can also be viewed within the users dashboard 'CRM' properties

\#\# Automation Overview  
Automations can really help save you time, while increasing your conversions or simply updating subscriber information automatically in the background.  
There are thousands of automation combinations you could create, here is a tiny list of what some users are automating:  
\* Simple form submits to sending a welcome email  
   
\* Updating customer information  
   
\* Webinar registrations then sending emails linked to sales funnels  
   
Select the automations tab as shown below.  
\#\#\#   
Select the automation type you require  
For this example we will select Blank automation. But you can read more about the Abandoned cart below.  
\[Abandoned Cart\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/ecommerce/abandoned-cart)  
Automations are built from three basic components:  
\* \*\*Triggers \>\*\* Whether someone visits your website, opens an email or updates their information. Your automation is ready to go 24/7.  
   
\* \*\*Conditional logic \>\*\* Create complex automations, or create individual automation rules with a simple “if this, then that” functionality.  
   
\* \*\*Actions \>\*\* Send them an eBook, update their information or even send your automated email campaigns.  
   
By selecting the notes function, you or your team members can leave helpful notes at each step of the automation funnel. This can be really helpful, to remind you of the step information, or simply adding instructions for your team to complete. Write it, save it, pin it.  
Watch in real time how your automations are going, track open rates, who clicked what and how many people have completed your automation.  
Setting goals will help you gauge if your automation is successful. When a subscriber reaches your specific goal it considers that as a win and registers it as a goal in your analytics dashboard. Once the user has reached your set goal, they will be removed from that automation.

If you are wanting to take donation payments or even pay what you want offers then this widget is for you.  
Navigate to the donation widget and place on any page you like.  
Unlike the normal store products and checkouts the donation widget works and is set up slightly differently. let's take a look in the main settings and set up to get your donations widget working.  
Payment gateway: To collect payments we offer two payment gateways your can use: Stripe and Braintree. Both are similar in design to set up. Simply add your Stripe/braintree api keys and it will connect automatically.  
The next step after adding your preferred payment system is to chose whether you want to set an allocated amount or even set it so the person making the donation can input their own donation value.  
Note: Store donations are not added to the store analytics dashboard  
Select the currency you wish to display and take payment in and you are almost done\!  
Next up is to add the customer to your \[email marketing lists\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/email-lists) 'this is optional' so when a customer makes a donation do you want to add them to a specific email list.  
\*\*Thank you page:\*\* After the customer makes a donation where do you want to send them? You can either show a simple thank you note or direct them to a specific page within your website or even an external URL.

\#\# Lead Generation  
The lead generation funnel template consists of two funnel steps:  
1, Landing page  
2, Thank you page  
\#\#\#   
What is a lead generation funnel?  
A lead generation 2 step funnel is a marketing strategy that involves two steps to convert a visitor into a lead. The first step is to capture the visitor's attention with an offer or an incentive, such as a free Ebook or a discount coupon, and to invite them to take action. This action could be to provide their contact information, such as their email address, to receive the offer.  
Once the visitor has taken the first step, they become a lead and are added to an \[\*\*email list\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/email-lists) or \[\*\*CRM\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/crm) of potential customers. The second step is to nurture this lead and guide them towards making a purchase decision. This can be achieved through a series of targeted emails, social media ads, or other marketing tactics that help build trust and credibility with the lead.  
The two-step funnel approach is designed to make the process of \*\*generating leads\*\* more efficient and effective by breaking it down into two distinct stages. By focusing on capturing attention and generating interest first, businesses can then focus on building a relationship with their leads, which can ultimately lead to more conversions and sales.  
The below image displays the 2 step funnel within the builder it's self. As you can see, you have a landing page and a thank you page.  
\*\*Note:\*\* To the right of the second step you will see a trophy icon. This denotes a funnel step goal. For example, Once the visitor has taken action on the landing page. They have hit a goal. You can see all goals within the funnel analytics tab.  
Below we have displayed the funnel steps in full page layout.  
The landing page is built using many elements, which located within the \[\*\*containers\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/container-widget) themselves. The main emphasis here is to generate leads for future promotion we may have in the future. To capture lead information we're using the \[\*\*forms widget\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/forms-widget)\*\*.\*\* Once the user fills in the form they will proceed to the next step 'Landing page' during this process we have captured their email and add them to an \[\*\*email list\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/email-lists)\*\*.\*\*  
The format and layout design for the lead generation landing page is broken down into multiple containers ensuring that all information is displayed correctly and most of all clear to read and understand. You will notice that in all our templates that we have added simple text to assist you what to write.  
\*\*Note:\*\* That any element of the funnel design can be fully edited to how you wish.  
Depending on the type of lead generation campaign you are running, will depict what type of thank you page you'll need.  
In our example, the landing page was to simply generate leads for future promotions to help build our email list and get people to join our community. In this case it was adding a link to the cta button to get them to join our Facebook community.

\#\# Appointment Booking  
The appointment booking funnel template consists of three funnel steps:  
1, Landing page  
2, Booking  
3, Thank you  
A 3-step booking appointment funnel is a series of steps that guides a user through the process of \[\*\*booking a meeting\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/funnel-designs/types-of-funnels/appointment-booking). The goal of the funnel is to make it as easy and straightforward as possible for the user to schedule a meeting with a service provider or book a reservation.  
Here are the three steps of a typical 3-step booking appointment funnel:  
\*\*Step 1:\*\* Landing page The first step of the funnel is a landing page that provides information about the service being offered and sets the user's expectations for the booking process. The landing page should be clear, concise, and visually appealing, with a prominent call-to-action (CTA) that invites the user to book an appointment. The landing page may also include social proof, such as customer testimonials or reviews, to build trust and credibility with the user.  
\*\*Step 2:\*\* Booking pop-up The second step of the funnel is a booking pop-up that appears when the user clicks the CTA on the landing page. The pop-up should be simple and easy to use, with a clear and concise form that captures the user's contact information, appointment preferences, and any other relevant details.  
\*\*Step 3:\*\* Thank you page The third and final step of the funnel is a thank-you page that confirms the user's appointment and provides any necessary next steps. The thank-you page should be visually appealing and include a message of gratitude for the user's business. It may also offer additional resources or incentives, such as a discount code for a future appointment or a link to related services or products.  
Overall, a 3-step booking appointment funnel can be an effective way to streamline the appointment booking process and reduce friction for users.

\#\# Onboarding  
The Onboarding funnel template consists of two funnel steps:  
1, Landing page  
2, Thank you  
\#\#\#   
What is an onboarding funnel?  
An onboarding funnel is a series of steps that a user goes through to become familiar with a product or service. The goal of the funnel is to guide the user toward using the product or service effectively, reducing the likelihood of confusion, frustration, and abandonment.  
In the context of a two-step onboarding funnel, we are using a \[\*\*quiz\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/quizzes-and-surveys) for the first step and a thank-you page for the second step, the funnel works as follows:  
\*\*Step 1:\*\* Quiz The first step of the funnel is a quiz that helps the user understand their needs and preferences in relation to the product or service. The quiz could ask questions about the user's goals, their level of experience with similar products or services, and any challenges they've encountered in the past. Based on the user's answers, the quiz could provide personalized recommendations for using the product or service effectively.  
\*\*Step 2:\*\* Thank-you page After the user completes the quiz, they are redirected to a thank-you page that reinforces their decision to use the product or service. The page might include a message thanking the user for taking the quiz and emphasizing the benefits of using the product or service. The page could also provide additional resources, such as links to tutorials or customer support.  
Overall, a two-step onboarding funnel with a quiz for the first step and a thank-you page for the second step can be an effective way to engage users and help them get started with a product or service. By providing personalized recommendations and reinforcing the benefits of the product or service, the funnel can help reduce the likelihood of confusion, frustration, and abandonment.  
The below image displays the 2 step funnel within the builder it's self. As you can see, you have a all the required steps to make it function for you.  
\*\*Note:\*\* To the right of the funnel step you will see a trophy icon. This denotes a funnel step goal. For example, Once the visitor has taken action on the landing page. They have hit a goal. You can see all goals within the funnel analytics tab.  
Below we have displayed the funnel step in full page layout.  
The landing page is built using many elements, which located within the \[\*\*containers\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/container-widget) themselves. The main emphasis here is to generate leads. By providing enough information for them to take action and move to the next step. To capture lead information we're using the \[\*\*quiz widget\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/quizzes-and-surveys)\*\*.\*\* Once the user fills in the quiz/survey they will proceed to the next step.

The webinar funnel template consists of four funnel steps:  
1, Landing page  
2, Registration pop up  
3, Thank you  
4, Webinar replay  
\#\#\#   
What is a webinar funnel?  
A webinar funnel is a marketing strategy that aims to attract potential customers and convert them into attendees of a webinar. A 4 step webinar funnel generally consists of the following steps:  
1\. \*\*Landing Page:\*\* This is the first step in the funnel, where you create a landing page that describes your webinar, its benefits and what attendees can expect to learn. The landing page should have a clear call-to-action (CTA) that directs visitors to register for the webinar.  
   
2\. \*\*Registration Pop-up:\*\* After visitors click on the CTA on the landing page, a registration pop-up appears where they can enter their details, such as name, email address, and any other relevant information required using the \[\*\*form widget\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/forms-widget). This step is important to capture the details of potential attendees.  
   
3\. \*\*Thank You Page:\*\* Once visitors submit their details, they are directed to a thank you page. This page should express gratitude for their registration and also provide them with information on what to expect next, such as details on how to join the webinar. An email can also be sent using the \[\*\*email automations\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows) tab.  
   
4\. \*\*Webinar Replay Page:\*\* This is the final step in the funnel, which appears after the webinar has been conducted. The replay page allows attendees who missed the live webinar to view the recorded version. This page can also be used to promote any related \[\*\*products\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/ecommerce) or services that were mentioned during the webinar.  
   
By following this 4 step webinar funnel, businesses can effectively attract and convert potential customers into attendees of their webinar, and eventually, into paying customers.  
The below image displays the 4 step funnel within the builder it's self. As you can see, you have a all the required steps to make it function for you.  
\*\*Note:\*\* To the right of the third and forth step you will see a trophy icon. This denotes a funnel step goal. For example, Once the visitor has taken action on the landing page. They have hit a goal. You can see all goals within the funnel analytics tab.  
Below we have displayed the funnel steps in full page layout.  
The landing page is built using many elements, which located within the \[\*\*containers\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/container-widget) themselves. The main emphasis here is to generate leads for the webinar. By providing enough information for them to take action and move to the next step. To capture lead information we're using the \[\*\*forms widget\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/forms-widget)\*\*.\*\* Once the user fills in the form they will proceed to the next step 'Thank you' during this process we have captured their email and add them to an \[\*\*email list\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/email-lists)\*\*.\*\*  
The format and layout design for the lead webinar funnel is broken down into multiple containers ensuring that all information is displayed correctly and most of all clear to read and understand. You will notice that in all our templates that we have added simple text to assist you what to write.  
\*\*Note:\*\* That any element of the funnel design can be fully edited to how you wish.  
For this example we have placed the registration pop up to display to the lower right of the screen. \*\*Note:\*\* there are multiple displays you can use. Depending on the type of webinar campaign you are running, will depict what type of information to add to the pop up.  
In our example, the pop up contains a timer widget, just to emphasis the importance of registering or maybe the date in which the webinar is taking place. Also adding in the form fields required.  
You may of noticed that on the landing page we have both a button and also a form widget. \*\*The great thing with our funnels\*\*, they not only work top to bottom, but also bottom to top. For example, after a users takes a specific action you can move them to any part of the funnel. In the case of the form on the landing page, once they fill out the form we just send them straight to the thank you page 'which skips out the popup widget'  
Depending on the type of webinar campaign you are running, will depict what type of thank you page information you'll need.  
In our example, the landing page was to simply generate leads for our webinar to help build our \[\*\*email list\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/email-lists). In this case it was adding a link to the \[\*\*cta button\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/button-widget) to get them to join our Facebook community.  
In most cases, people who run webinars like to add a replay of that webinar to allow people to re-watch or even for people to purchase. The page is very simple and contains a \[\*\*video embed\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/video). And again displaying a call to action to join our community. You could also \[\*\*embed a product\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/ecommerce/creating-store-products) that you wish to sell if required.

\#\# A/B Split Testing  
A/B split testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or a funnel to determine which one performs better. In the context of funnels, A/B split testing involves creating two variations of the entire funnel or just individual funnel steps. The goal is to determine which variation performs better in terms of conversions, whether that's getting people to sign up for a newsletter or purchase a product.  
A/B split testing is so powerful because it allows you to make \*\*data-driven decisions\*\*. Instead of guessing which version of your funnel is better, you can rely on the results of the test to guide your decision-making. By identifying which elements of your funnel are most effective, you can optimize your funnel to maximize conversions and revenue.  
When it comes to strategies for A/B split testing funnels, there are several best practices to keep in mind:  
1\. \*\*Test one variable at a time:\*\* To accurately determine which element of your funnel is causing a change in performance, it's important to only test one variable at a time. This could be the copy, the design, the offer, or any other element of the funnel.  
   
2\. \*\*Test for statistical significance:\*\* When running A/B tests, it's important to ensure that the results are statistically significant. This means that the difference between the two versions of the funnel is large enough to be considered meaningful.  
   
3\. \*\*Test continuously:\*\* Your funnel is never truly "finished." Even after you've optimized it to the best of your ability, there's always room for improvement. By continuously testing new ideas and iterations, you can ensure that your funnel is always performing at its best.  
   
4\. \*\*Keep track of your results:\*\* Finally, it's important to keep track of your A/B test results over time. This will allow you to identify patterns and trends, and make informed decisions about how to optimize your funnel moving forward.  
   
Overall, A/B split testing is a powerful tool for optimizing funnels and driving conversions. By following best practices and continuously testing new ideas, you can ensure that your funnel is always performing at its best.  
To get started with creating your first A/B split test simply navigate to the funnel step you would like to test. Upon hovering over the grey bar it will display A/B TEST as shown below  
Once you have selected which step and clicked the A/B TEST a pop up will display. From here you have 2 options:  
\*\*Duplicating the funnel step\*\* will automatically create an exact copy of the entire funnel step. You can edit to your requirements. Well will talk about that below.  
Selecting the \*\*New Page option\*\*, basically means you can create a page from scratch using one of our pre-made page designs.  
For this example we will go ahead and select the \*\*duplicate step\*\* option.  
\#\#\#   
Selecting the best type of test  
As mentioned in the intro, where we covered the best practices.  
\> \*\*Test one variable at a time:\*\* To accurately determine which element of your funnel is causing a change in performance, it's important to only test one variable at a time. This could be the copy, the design, the offer, or any other element of the funnel.  
So before we dive in and start making changes to the split test funnel step, below you will see that a new pop up appears once you select the A/B Test.  
Let's break this section down.  
The split test bar will display both steps A & B or simply put. Page one and Page two. Within the bar you will see a variety of numbers, these are your analytics that cover both how many people visited each side of the funnel step and also conversion %. Meaning how many people visited the funnel step and moved to the next.  
The winner select is a \*\*powerful feature\*\* to our funnels. The winner select enables you to select one of two option:  
\* \*\*Automatically:\*\* This feature will automate your split testing and optimise the funnel for you\!  
   
\* \*\*Manually:\*\* This option enables you to manually override the winning step.  
   
When selecting the \*\*automatic winner\*\* option you can add a winner threshold number, this basically means: When the funnel step reaches a certain visitors, I want you to automatically select the winning side that has most conversions.  
\*\*Top tip:\*\* When thinking of a number to put, think about how many people do i think would come to my funnel. If you have a tiny audience then set the number lower. But, if you have large visitor traffic then set it higher. A good number to start with, if you're just getting started out is 100\. This will give you plenty of data and analytics to make \*\*data-driven decisions.\*\*  
When selecting the \*\*Manual winner\*\* option you can select a winner by simply clicking the Select button, this basically means: When the funnel step reaches a certain visitors, I want to manually select the winning side based on the visitor or conversion rate.  
\*\*Note:\*\* When using either option, Automatic or Manual. Once you have either selected the winner or let the automation select it for you. The non winning step will be deleted.  
When it comes to editing your new split test funnel step as mention earlier it's important to test small changes so you can get better data driven insights. So what type of things could you change?  
Here are a few examples/ideas of elements you could split test in your funnel. The key is to focus on one variable at a time and ensure that your test results are statistically significant.  
Try testing different headlines to see which one resonates best with your audience.  
Similar to headline copy, try testing different variations of your body copy to see which one converts better.  
Call-to-action (CTA) copy  
The CTA is a critical element of any funnel, so it's important to get it right. Test different variations of your CTA copy to see which one drives the most conversions.  
The design of your CTA button can also have a big impact on conversions. Try testing different colors, sizes, and shapes to see which one works best  
Some funnels rely heavily on visuals to drive conversions. Try testing whether images or videos perform better for your audience.  
If you have a lead generation form in your funnel, try testing different variations of the form fields to see which one converts the most leads.  
If you're offering a product or service, try testing different variations of your offer to see which one resonates best with your audience.  
If you're selling a product or service, try testing different price points to see which one drives the most sales.  
The layout of your funnel can also impact conversions. Try testing different variations of your page layout to see which one performs best.  
Below are two images, both with the same head line and call to action, the only difference is the actual layout design. Which one would make you click.  
The great feature of our funnels is the actual flexibility it gives you to help enhance your conversions, whether that be manually selecting the winning side or letting the funnel automation take over and optimize it for you.  
You can split test any step in your funnels, whether that be just a page to even split testing your checkout pages and more.  
But remember the best practices we mentioned earlier.

\#\# Online course funnel  
The Online course funnel consists of four main funnel steps:  
1, Landing page  
2, Order page  
3, Thank you page  
4, Course content  
\#\#\#   
What is an online course funnel?  
An online course funnel is a marketing strategy designed to attract potential students and guide them through the process of signing up for and completing an online course. The four main funnel steps for an online course are:  
\*\*Step 1: Landing Page:\*\* The landing page is the first step in the funnel and serves as the starting point for potential students. It should be designed to capture their attention and provide a clear overview of the course content, including course features, benefits, and outcomes. It should also include a call-to-action (CTA) button or form that prompts users to take the next step in the funnel.  
\*\*Step 2: Checkout Page:\*\* Once users click on the CTA, they are directed to a checkout page where they can register/pay for the course. This step is critical as it requires students to provide their personal and payment information to complete the purchase. It is important to ensure that the checkout process is smooth and secure to avoid \*\*cart abandonment\*\*.  
\*\*Step 3: Thank You Page:\*\* After users successfully complete the \*\*checkout\*\* process, they are redirected to a thank you page. This page should confirm their purchase, provide details on next steps, and offer any additional resources or bonuses. It is also an opportunity to upsell other courses or related products. Additionally, the thank you page should include a course module navigation to help members get started with the course.  
\*\*Step 4: Course Content:\*\* The final step in the funnel is the actual course content. This is where students access the course materials and start their learning journey. It is important to ensure that the course is engaging, interactive, and easy to navigate. Additionally, providing regular feedback, assessments, and \*\*quizzes\*\* can help students stay motivated and track their progress.  
By following these four funnel steps, you can create a seamless and effective online course funnel that attracts potential students and guides them towards completing your course.  
The below image displays the 4 step funnel within the builder it's self. As you can see, you have a all the required steps to make it function for you.  
Below we have displayed the funnel step in full page layout.  
\*\*Note:\*\* You may of noticed that in the funnel step image above, there are more than 4 steps. The additional steps ie Step 6 are for additional modules you may have in your course.  
\*\*Also note\*\*, that we have 2 order pages  
\*\*1, Course product pre-selected\*\*  
\*\*2, User added to cart\*\*  
We will explain that in more detail below.  
The landing page is built using many elements, which located within the \*\*containers\*\* themselves. The main emphasis here is to generate leads. By providing enough information for them to take action and move to the next step.  
The format and layout design for the opt in funnel is broken down into multiple containers ensuring that all information is displayed correctly and most of all clear to read and understand. You will notice that in all our templates that we have added simple text to assist you what to write.  
\*\*Note:\*\* That any element of the funnel design can be fully edited to how you wish.  
Once the visitor has clicked on any \*\*button\*\* on the landing page, the next step in the funnel is the order page where your product/s are displayed.  
Note: On this order page we have opted for a \*\*2 step checkout\*\* process, for example the visitor enters their personal details before viewing the payment step. You can set this up to how you feel is best for you. The reason why we opted to use a two step checkout is that we can follow up with the \*\*abandoned cart\*\* or even a simple email \*\*automation campaign\*\*.  
Note: In this funnel we are also using a button to add the product directly to the cart and takes them straight to the checkout with the item already added.  
Using The Cart checkout option. For example as mentioned above, items are automatically added to the cart once the users taps a button.  
As mentioned above. After users successfully complete the \*\*checkout\*\* process, they are redirected to a thank you page. This page should confirm their purchase, provide details on next steps, and offer any additional resources or bonuses. It is also an opportunity to upsell other courses or related products. Additionally, the thank you page should include a course module navigation to help members get started with the course.  
The final step in the funnel is the actual course content. This is where students access the course materials and start their learning journey. It is important to ensure that the course is engaging, interactive, and easy to navigate. Additionally, providing regular feedback, assessments, and \*\*quizzes\*\* can help students stay motivated.

\#\# Summit funnel  
The summit funnel consists of three main funnel steps:  
1, Landing page  
2, Order page  
3, Thank you page  
A 3 step summit funnel is a sales strategy used by online businesses to promote and sell virtual or physical attendance summits. The funnel typically consists of three steps:  
\*\*Step 1: Landing page\*\* \- This is the first page the potential attendee sees when they click on an advertisement or link. The landing page's primary goal is to grab the visitor's attention and encourage them to register for the virtual summit. This page typically provides information about the summit content, including the date, time, and location, the list of speakers attending, the topics that will be covered, and answers to commonly asked questions.  
\*\*Step 2: Order page\*\* \- Once the potential attendee clicks on the "register" or "attend" button, they are directed to the product page. This page contains additional information about the summit and the checkout process. The page also offers an opportunity to \*\*upgrade to a higher paid ticket\*\* for more features, such as one-to-one coaching with the speakers or access to additional exclusive content. This page reiterates the speakers and emphasizes the \*\*benefits of attending\*\* the summit.  
\*\*Step 3: Thank you page\*\* \- After the attendee has completed the registration and payment, they are directed to the thank you page. This page confirms the registration and provides a call-to-action (CTA) for the attendee to check their email for further instructions on accessing the summit.  
The goal of the 3 step summit funnel is to create a seamless and effective sales process that encourages potential attendees to register for the summit. By breaking the process into clear steps, businesses can guide potential attendees through the registration process and increase their chances of making a sale. Additionally, offering an upgrade option for more features and exclusive content can help businesses generate additional revenue from the summit.  
The below image displays the 3 step funnel within the builder it's self. As you can see, you have a all the required steps to make it function for you.  
Note: To the right of the funnel step you will see a trophy icon. This denotes a funnel step goal. For example, Once the visitor has taken action on the landing page. They have hit a goal. You can see all goals within the funnel analytics tab.  
Below we have displayed the funnel step in full page layout.  
The landing page is built using many elements, which located within the \*\*containers\*\* themselves. The main emphasis here is to generate leads. By providing enough information for them to take action and move to the next step.  
The format and layout design for the summit funnel is broken down into multiple containers ensuring that all information is displayed correctly and most of all clear to read and understand. You will notice that in all our templates that we have added simple text to assist you what to write.  
\*\*Note:\*\* That any element of the funnel design can be fully edited to how you wish.  
Once the visitor has clicked on any \*\*button\*\* on the landing page, the next step in the funnel is the order page where your product/s are displayed.  
\*\*Note:\*\* As mentioned above, we have added the option to increase cart revenue by adding an additional product at a higher price. As you can see on the image below, there are now two products on the checkout and the user can select which option they prefer.  
Using The multi product cart checkout option. You can set that up 'shown in the image below'  
As mentioned above. After the attendee has completed the registration and payment, they are directed to the thank you page. This page confirms the registration and provides a call-to-action (CTA) for the attendee to check their email for further instructions on accessing the summit.

\#\# Store  
The store widget is a great element for displaying your store products on any page or even within your blog posts.  
To add your store widget, simply navigate to the store widget:  
The first step to take is adding the products you want to display. Select the edit products tab as show below. This opens up a new window where you can add products by:  
\* All products from selected categories  
   
\* and how many you want to display.  
   
Many of the options in this setting a more visual settings. So let's take a look at the important settings more so.  
The store process tab gives you two options: Add to cart or buy now.  
\*\*Add to cart:\*\* If you want your visitors to simply add more than one item to their shopping carts this option is for you. When they click add to cart it will automatically store that item in their cart awaiting further actions.  
\*\*Buy now:\*\* By selecting the buy now button, when your visitor clicks the buy now button they will automatically be shown the payment 'checkout' page ready to make the purchase.  
Again the product feed looks is user choice by selecting the style and design of the store product widget. Let's take a closer look:  
There \*\*three main layout designs\*\* when displaying your products on page as shown in the image above. And also the content alignment, this configures where you want the text layout, left \- center or to the right.  
\*\*Discounted products badge type:\*\* If you have discounts allocated to certain products you can visually display them directly on the item itself. There are four options to chose from:  
\* None: Will not show any information  
   
\* Sale: Will display if the item is on sale  
   
\* Discount amount: If the item has been discounted by a currency value $  
   
\* Discount percentage: If the item has been discounted by a certain % value

\# Zapier  
Access thousands of automations using Zapier  
Zapier is an automation tool that lets you easily create workflows that involve common web apps and services. Zapier uses a simple trigger and action for creating commands, akin to "if this happens, then do that.

How Zapier works  
You use Zapier's web interface to create commands called zaps. Each zap is composed of two main parts: a trigger and an action.  
The trigger is the event that kicks off the zap — in programming lingo, you can think of it as the "if this happens…" part of the operation. Zapier works with more than 2,000 apps and services, so there are countless triggers you can base a zap on.  
The action is the event that completes the zap. It's the "then do this" part of the command and the automation that simplifies your task or workflow. For example, a zap might be written to create an event on a Google Calendar based on every new Trello card that gets added to your board, or a zap might create a to-do list in an app like Todo list based on emails you star or flag in Gmail.

To connect a domain to your website or funnel, click on \*\*Website/Funnel Settings\*\* and then \*\*Domains\*\*.  
Type your website url 'enter domain name' and click \*\*Connect Domain\*\*.  
After adding the domain, a screen with \*\*2 DNS records\*\* will show. These are the records you need to add to your domain settings in your domain provider.  
Contact the customer support of your service provider where you registered your domain to assist you with this if you are unsure of what to do.  
Every domain provider should allow you to add these records to your domain. If you can't find them, you can contact your domain provider and ask how to add them. They will connect your domain to your website.  
\_\*\*NOTE:\*\*\_ \_Make sure that there aren't any duplicating records, as they will result in a not properly connected domain. You should have only one A record with @ as Host/Name and only one CNAME record with www as Host/Name.\_  
Once the records have been added, it can take up to a few hours for the propagation and verification to be completed, and once that is done, the records block will turn from \*\*Red\*\* to \*\*Green\*\* and will indicate that \_'This domain is currently\_ \_\*\*Active\!\*\*\_\_'\_

3\. \[Types of Funnels\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/funnel-designs/types-of-funnels)  
\#\# Membership funnel  
The membership funnel consists of four main funnel steps:  
1, Landing page  
2, Order page  
3, Thank you page  
4, Members area  
\#\#\#   
What is a membership funnel?  
A membership 4 step funnel is a sales strategy used by online businesses to sell membership-based products or services. The funnel typically consists of four steps:  
\*\*Step 1: Landing page\*\* \- This is the first page the potential member sees when they click on an advertisement or link. The landing page's primary goal is to grab the visitor's attention and encourage them to learn more about the membership program. This page typically provides information about the membership benefits, features, and pricing.  
\*\*Step 2: Order page\*\* \- Once the potential member clicks on the "join" or "subscribe" button, they are directed to the order page. This page contains additional information about the membership program and the checkout process.  
\*\*Step 3: Thank you page\*\* \- After the member has completed the purchase, they are directed to the thank you page. This page confirms the membership purchase and provides a call-to-action (CTA) for the member to access the membership area.  
\*\*Step 4: Membership area\*\* \- This is the final step of the funnel, where the member gains access to the membership program. The membership area typically contains the exclusive content, benefits, and features promised in the sales process.  
The goal of the membership 4 step funnel is to create a seamless and effective sales process that encourages the potential member to take action and become a paying member. By breaking the process into clear steps, businesses can guide potential members through the purchase process and increase their chances of gaining more recurring revenue through their membership program.  
The below image displays the 4 step funnel within the builder it's self. As you can see, you have a all the required steps to make it function for you.  
\*\*Note:\*\* To the right of the funnel step you will see a trophy icon. This denotes a funnel step goal. For example, Once the visitor has taken action on the landing page. They have hit a goal. You can see all goals within the funnel analytics tab.  
Below we have displayed the funnel step in full page layout.  
The landing page is built using many elements, which located within the \*\*containers\*\* themselves. The main emphasis here is to generate leads. By providing enough information for them to take action and move to the next step.  
The format and layout design for the membership funnel is broken down into multiple containers ensuring that all information is displayed correctly and most of all clear to read and understand. You will notice that in all our templates that we have added simple text to assist you what to write.  
\*\*Note:\*\* That any element of the funnel design can be fully edited to how you wish.  
Note: As we are selling two types of membership  
1, Monthly  
2, Yearly  
We want to add the selected item directly to the cart when the visitor taps a button. The image below explains how to do such strategy.  
Once the visitor has clicked on any \*\*button\*\* on the landing page, the next step in the funnel is the order page where your product/s are displayed.  
Note: On this order page we have opted for a \*\*2 step checkout\*\* process, for example the visitor enters their personal details before viewing the payment step. You can set this up to how you feel is best for you. The reason why we opted to use a two step checkout is that we can follow up with the \*\*abandoned cart\*\* or even a simple email \*\*automation campaign\*\*.  
Using The Cart checkout option. For example as mentioned above, items are automatically added to the cart once the users taps a button. You can set that up 'shown in the image below':  
As mentioned above. After users successfully complete the \*\*checkout\*\* process, they are redirected to a thank you page. This page should confirm their purchase, provide details on next steps, and offer any additional resources or bonuses. It is also an opportunity to upsell other courses or related products. Additionally, the thank you page should include membership navigation to help members get started with the membership program.  
The final step in the funnel is the actual member area. This is where members access the content materials and start their learning journey.  
With all members within your website/funnel they also have access to their own members management area.  
Here they can manage multiple things from updating personal information, accessing member only areas and also viewing what products and downloads they may have purchased.

\#\# Make  
\*\*Make\*\* Is a tool that helps you to automate manual processes, without needing code. They refer to themselves as ‘the glue of the internet’, helping their customers to connect together apps and services.  
Once clicking the link above you will be invited to add the Make app to your make account. Note if you do not have a Make account you can sign up there also.  
To understand how Make works, you need to know what an API is. An API (application program interface) is something that a software provider (like MailChimp, Shopify, or PayPal) provides so developers can access data within their applications. For example, a developer writes code that detects all new Shopify orders via the Shopify API, then subscribes them to a MailChimp newsletter via the MailChimp API.  
Instead of needing the code, Make has turned these complicated APIs into simple blocks that can be connected with a simple drag-and-drop. Make calls these blocks ‘Modules’ and the visual connections between them ‘Scenarios’.  
Once set up, Make runs 24-7,

\#\# Hero  
Hero funnel template consists of one funnel step:  
1, Landing page  
The hero funnel is a popular method used for social media marketing that allows you to create a landing page with multiple links to your content. The purpose of a hero funnel is to provide a way to share multiple links with your audience in a simple and visually appealing way, rather than having to constantly update your bio or post new content with links.  
You can create a 'landing page' with a unique URL that houses multiple clickable buttons, each linking to a specific piece of content, such as blog posts, videos, products, social media profiles, or external websites. This can be particularly useful for businesses or individuals who have a variety of content to share, but want to avoid cluttering their social media bio or posts with multiple links. Overall, the purpose of a hero funnel is to provide an easy and streamlined way for you to share multiple links with their audience on social media, while also providing useful analytics and additional features to enhance your marketing efforts.  
The below image displays the 1 step funnel within the builder it's self. As you can see, you have a all the required steps to make it function for you.  
\*\*Note:\*\* To the right of the funnel step you will see a trophy icon. This denotes a funnel step goal. For example, Once the visitor has taken action on the landing page. They have hit a goal. You can see all goals within the funnel analytics tab.  
Below we have displayed the funnel step in full page layout.  
The landing page is built using many elements, which located within the \[\*\*containers\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/container-widget) themselves. The main emphasis here is to generate leads. By providing enough information for them to take action and move to the next step. To capture lead information we're using the \[\*\*forms widget\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/forms-widget)\*\*.\*\* Once the user fills in the form they will proceed to the next step if you need to add one. During this process we have captured their email and add them to an \[\*\*email list\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/email-lists)\*\*.\*\* The format and layout design for the hero funnel is broken down into multiple containers ensuring that all information is displayed correctly and most of all clear to read and understand. You will notice that in all our templates that we have added simple text to assist you what to write.  
\*\*Note:\*\* That any element of the funnel design can be fully edited to how you wish.

First navigate to the settings cog \> select applications then select the email provider you already use.  
Each provider will have it's own type of connection settings. Most of which are simply adding your API key provided by the provider it's self. Simply paste in the credentials and it will connect automatically for you.

3\. \[Widgets\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets)  
\#\# Checkout  
The checkout widget enables you to add your checkouts anywhere on your website, funnels and even inside your blog posts in one click.  
To add your checkout widget to your block simply select the checkout widget and drop into the page.  
Once you have your checkout on the page, the next step is to select the products tab as highlighted below in step 1  
2\. Adding bump offers to increase cart value  
   
3\. Select the product or products you want to add to the checkout.  
   
4\. Here you have 2 options. Product select or cart checkout. \*\*Product select\*\* means the product or products you want to add to that specific checkout widget. \*\*Cart checkout\*\* means: If you have a previous page where users can add products to a cart and you want them to go to another page after adding items to their cart, for example in funnels this is a great option.  
   
5\. Allowing users to select products if you are displaying more than one.  
   
In the example below we have selected 2 store items we want to display in this checkout widget. You can modify the visual elements later on to.  
Adding bump offers can increase your overall cart revenue by displaying store items you would like to try and sell additionally to the user.  
To add a bump offer, simply select the store item you want to add, and apply the settings to how you want the bump offer to display. In this example we are showing the bump offer in the checkout flow, alternatively you can move it to below the order summary.  
As you can see it can be a seamless way to increase your store revenue.  
With the checkout styling you have endless options to design the perfect checkout that suits your brand. But let's look at the important parts.  
\*\*Checkout style:\*\* Currently there are 3 checkout style options to chose from as highlight in the image above.  
Checkout step process: The checkout step process enables you to select from one, two or even a three step checkout process.  
Example:  
\*\*1 Step checkout\*\*: As shown above, includes all the customer input information and payment details all in one place. Whereas a \*\*two step checkout\*\* process will have the user input info on one step then the next step would be the payment step. Great for \[\*\*abandoned cart\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/ecommerce/abandoned-cart) scenarios. \*\*A three step\*\* checkout process will break it down further, normally name and email in the first step, delivery info on step two then the third step would be the payment section  
The checkout settings tab enables you to manage the more technical section where you can:  
\* Direct people who purchase to any page  
   
\* Adding customers to your email lists and adding tags for segmentation.  
   
\*\*Thank you page:\*\* When the customer purchases the store item on the checkout, where do you want to send them. You can send them to a custom thank you page, any page in your website, any funnel step or even to an external URL like a facebook group etc.  
\*\*Allow discounts:\*\* If you have set up discounts within your store settings and you want to allow discounts on the selected items in your checkout then you can. This is totally optional.  
\*\*Enable customer registrations:\*\* Basically it will create a member so when they purchase again they can simply log in and their details will be auto populated in the checkout. Helping to speed up return purchases.  
\*\*Asking for the customers address:\*\* Again this is an optional feature. It helps reduce the user input when purchasing products that do not require a physical address. For example if you are selling digital products then you may not require an address from the customer.  
\*\*Connect to email marketing:\*\* Once the customer has purchased you can add them to your email list, or if you an outside provider for example MailChimp, then you can add them to your preferred MailChimp list.  
\*\*Tag customer on new order:\*\* This is great if you want to track purchases using tags. This helps segment your customers for later promotions or you can use tags within the automations to filter customers through further on email campaigns and more.

\#\# Email Domain Connection  
To start sending emails in the Email Marketing section, you need to first connect your domain. You can do that in the Emails & Automation section \> Settings.  
There you have the option to add your domain. All you need to do is add the \*\*CNAME\*\* and \*\*TXT\*\* records provided by you after adding the domain to the platform.  
Simply go to the domain settings where you've purchased the domain and find the DNS Records area to add the \*\*CNAME\*\* and \*\*TXT\*\* records. It might take some time for the DNS records to update after adding them so don't worry, check again in 10-15 minutes and in most cases it should be showing as 'Verified' in green.  
If you already have the domain connected to another site and have the DNS records. Then it requires you to verify via email link for additional websites/funnels. Once you have entered your domain url, you will be asked to provide a valid email address. Once complete you will receive a confirmation link via email.  
Once your domain has been verified it will turn green in color and you can start sending email campaigns  
Before you venture off in to the campaigns or automations section. Be sure to complete the boxes below:  
\* \*\*Default Sender Name \>\*\* This will be the name that your subscribers will see, who the email is from.  
   
\* \*\*Default System Email \>\*\* Ensure the information is correct, as this will be your email address shown.

Once you've decided on a number go ahead and purchase it.  
Note: You can 'purchase' a number without paying anything. It will be defined as a trial number that you can use for testing purposes only. Once you enter your billing details, the number will become active.  
Once done it will take you through the next steps, which are mostly tick boxes and verifying your number select.  
Tick agree and Click next  
The \*\*select end user\*\* step is where you can chose between Business or Individual. This is optional to what you do. For example, when selecting \*\*Business\*\* you will have to fill out your business credentials. If selecting \*\*Individual\*\*, no business details are required \- just a photo ID is required.  
When you reach this step, if you have not already set up your bundle, you will need to do that first. If you have already created a bundle in Twilio, it will be displayed in the 'Assign Approved Bundle' tab.  
To create a bundle within Twilio, navigate to the \*\*main dashboard\*\* \> \*\*Regulatory Compliance\*\* \> \*\*Bundles\*\*  
Follow the steps \- it will guide you through step by step.  
Creating a Messaging Service in Twilio enables you to send messages. To set up your messaging service, go to the main Twilio \*\*dashboard\*\* and select \*\*Messaging\*\* \> \*\*Services\*\*. You will then see the dashboard shown in the image below.  
Messaging Services are for sending bulk SMS and WhatsApp messages.  
\#\#\#   
Link The Service to Your Phone Number  
The final step is to link the Messaging Service to your Twilio phone number.  
First, navigate to the main Twilio \*\*dashboard\*\* \> \*\*Phone numbers\*\* \> \*\*Manage\*\* \> \*\*Active numbers\*\*  
Click on your phone number you want to add the messaging service to.  
Once you have selected the number to add the service to, a new window will open. Scroll down toward the bottom.  
Under the \*\*Messaging Service\*\* tab you will be able to select the service you have created. Select the service and click \*\*Save\*\* at the bottom left side.  
That's you now connected with Twilio and ready to start sending SMS and WhatsApp messages to your customers.

\#\#\#   
How to get your visitors to the right place.

Alternatively if you are using a sales funnel, simply direct them to the checkout step in your funnel. This will register the purchase conversion in both your store and funnel revenue analytics tab.  
\#\#\#   
Where to view store analytics.  
There are two places you can see the abandoned cart analytics:

\#\# Digital download funnel  
The digital download funnel consists of three main funnel steps:  
1, Landing page  
2, Order page  
3, Thank you page  
\#\#\#   
What is a digital download funnel?  
A digital download 3 step funnel is a sales strategy used by online businesses to sell digital products such as ebooks, courses, software, or any other downloadable product. The funnel typically consists of three steps:  
\*\*Step 1: Landing page\*\* \- This is the first page the potential customer sees when they click on an advertisement or link. The landing page's primary goal is to grab the visitor's attention and encourage them to take the next step by providing information about the digital download and its price.  
\*\*Step 2: Sales/Checkout page\*\* \- Once the potential customer clicks on the "buy" or "download" button, they are directed to the sales/checkout page. This page contains the product details, additional information, and an option to pay for the digital download.  
\*\*Step 3: Thank you page\*\* \- After the customer has completed the purchase, they are directed to the thank you page. This page confirms the purchase and provides a call-to-action (CTA) for the customer to download the purchased product. Alternatively the item is sent via email.  
The goal of the digital download 3 step funnel is to create a smooth and effective sales process that encourages the customer to take action and complete the purchase. By breaking the process into three clear steps, businesses can guide potential customers through the purchase process and increase their chances of making a sale.  
The below image displays the 3 step funnel within the builder it's self. As you can see, you have all the required steps to make it function for you.  
Note: To the right of the funnel step you will see a trophy icon. This denotes a funnel step goal. For example, Once the visitor has taken action on the landing page. They have hit a goal. You can see all goals within the funnel analytics tab.  
Below we have displayed the funnel step in full page layout.  
The landing page is built using many elements, which located within the \*\*containers\*\* themselves. The main emphasis here is to generate leads and make sales. By providing enough information for them to take action and move to the next step.  
The format and layout design for the digital download funnel is broken down into multiple containers ensuring that all information is displayed correctly and most of all clear to read and understand. You will notice that in all our templates that we have added simple text to assist you what to write.  
Once the visitor has clicked on any \*\*button\*\* on the landing page, the next step in the funnel is the order page where your product/s are displayed.  
Note: On this order page we have opted for a \*\*2 step checkout\*\* process, for example the visitor enters their personal details before viewing the payment step. You can set this up to how you feel is best for you. The reason why we opted to use a two step checkout is that we can follow up with the \*\*abandoned cart\*\* or even a simple email \*\*automation campaign\*\*.  
As mentioned above. After users successfully complete the \*\*checkout\*\* process, they are redirected to a thank you page. This page should confirm their purchase, provide details on next steps, and offer any additional resources or bonuses. It is also an opportunity to upsell other courses or related products. Additionally, the thank you page should include a call to action button to download the digital file.

\*\*Websites:\*\* You will see all websites that you have created  
As mentioned you can access your funnels in another place \> Navigate to the main funnel icon on the tool bar:  
To create a new funnel select the 'Create New Funnel' Button as show in the image above. From here it will open the funnel template library for you to choose one of our pre-designed themes. Select the one you like, give it a name then hit save. Your new funnel has now been added:  
This is where the power and flexibility really comes in to play\! Depending on your selected plan, each plan comes with a different amount of funnels. But the following context applies to any plan.  
You have already seen how to create a new funnel and the same goes when creating a new website. There are some additional options to help you get the most from using Funnels for your own projects or even setting up funnels for your own clients.  
\*\*For example:\*\* When you create an account with it is classed as a Project. Within your project you can create a website and numerous funnels. You can also Move the funnel outside of the website so you can have it separate from your main Project URL or move the funnel to another project.  
Let's take for example that I have a website, and I want to add a funnel to my website.  
Select the funnel you want to move \> click the cog icon and this window will display.  
Once selected a new window will display, this time select the website you want to add that funnel to:  
Store Products, Orders, Members, Contacts and Messages will NOT BE MOVED.  
Once we have moved the funnel to the selected website, you will see a change within the funnel | website tab. Let's take a look:  
You can now see that under the main funnel tab, you can see that the funnel is now attached to a website 'Project' So if you create an additional funnel it will display 2 Funnels. Denoting that this specific website has two funnel attached.  
\#\#\#   
Remove funnel from website  
If you want to remove a funnel from a specific website/project \- Navigate to the funnel you want to move  
\*\*Note:\*\* this does not delete the funnel. It just moves it. You will see this warning notice display also:  
Are you sure you want to make this funnel independent of the website? Existing Store Products, Orders, Members, Contacts and Messages will not be moved and will stay on the website.  
Sharing you funnel enables you to share your entire funnel to another person. So for example if you have a friend who loves your killer sales funnel and you want to sell it or just share for free you can. Simply navigate to the funnel options tab and select share. It will give you a custom link that you can share or if selling add to an email or use as a redirect page.

 \_https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/why-sms-marketing-is-effective\_

1\. \[Platform\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform)  
3\. \[Messaging & Workflows\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows)  
\#\# Why SMS Marketing is Effective  
SMS marketing leverages the immediacy and high engagement rate of text messages. Unlike email marketing, which can often get lost in cluttered inboxes, SMS marketing is designed for \*\*brevity, clarity, and urgency\*\*. Here’s why it stands out:  
1\. \*\*High Open and Response Rates\*\*: SMS messages have an \*\*open rate of over 98%\*\*, with most messages read within minutes of being received. This is far higher than the average email open rate, making SMS a highly effective medium for reaching your audience quickly.  
   
2\. \*\*Character Limit Drives Precision\*\*: The \*\*160-character limit\*\* (for a standard SMS) forces marketers to be concise and focused. Messages are direct and to the point, reducing the risk of losing the reader’s attention. This makes SMS ideal for communicating short, impactful messages without overwhelming the recipient.  
   
3\. \*\*Personal and Immediate\*\*: Text messages are inherently more personal because they appear directly in the recipient’s phone messages, often alongside conversations with friends and family. This personal touch can make customers feel more engaged.  
   
4\. \*\*Minimal Risk of Spam\*\*: SMS marketing doesn’t have the same spam issues that email does. With strict regulations and opt-in requirements, recipients of SMS messages have chosen to receive communications, resulting in more targeted and effective marketing.  
   
5\. \*\*Better for Real-Time Updates\*\*: SMS is perfect for time-sensitive information like promotions, flash sales, appointment reminders, or order updates. Because people check their texts more frequently, SMS ensures these messages are seen quickly.  
   
\#\#\#   
Best Use Cases for SMS Marketing  
1\. \*\*Promotions and Discounts\*\*: SMS is ideal for sharing exclusive discounts, limited-time offers, or flash sales. A well-timed promotional message can prompt immediate action, driving sales and increasing customer engagement.  
   
 \*\*Example\*\*: “Exclusive 30% off today only\! Use code SAVE30 at checkout. Shop now: \\\[link\\\]”  
   
2\. \*\*Appointment Reminders and Confirmations\*\*: Service-based businesses can use SMS to send reminders, reducing no-shows and keeping clients informed.  
   
 \*\*Example\*\*: “Reminder: Your appointment at \\\[Business Name\\\] is tomorrow at 2 PM. Reply ‘YES’ to confirm.”  
   
3\. \*\*Order and Delivery Updates\*\*: E-commerce businesses can keep customers updated on their order status and delivery information.  
   
 \*\*Example\*\*: “Your order \#12345 has been shipped\! Track it here: \\\[link\\\].”  
   
4\. \*\*Event Invitations and Updates\*\*: SMS is great for sending invitations to events, webinars, or product launches, as well as for providing real-time updates during the event.  
   
 \*\*Example\*\*: “Don’t forget our webinar starts in 30 minutes\! Join here: \\\[link\\\]”  
   
5\. \*\*Feedback and Surveys\*\*: After a purchase or service, businesses can request feedback or conduct short surveys via SMS, increasing response rates.  
   
 \*\*Example\*\*: “How was your experience with us? Reply with a rating from 1 to 5.”

Why SMS Over WhatsApp or Email?  
While WhatsApp marketing shares some similarities with SMS, such as its directness and conversational tone, it has a more flexible format that allows longer messages, multimedia, and even automated bots. SMS, on the other hand, is simpler, more focused, and less reliant on the recipient having a particular app installed.  
Email is ideal for more detailed communications, newsletters, or content-heavy updates. But SMS’s character limit and high engagement rate make it the go-to for time-sensitive, direct, and actionable messages.  
In summary, SMS marketing is best for delivering urgent, concise messages that need immediate attention or action. Its unique combination of high engagement, personal touch, and minimal spam risk makes it a valuable tool for businesses to connect with their customers effectively. By leveraging SMS for the right use cases—like promotions, updates, and reminders—companies can achieve better results and deeper customer relationships.

Lay the groundwork for your future promotions. Collect emails in an interactive way using quizzes, and use your segmented lists to create targeted campaigns.  
In this article you will discover how to create, manage and use quizzes to help generate leads and sales for your business. Firstly navigate to the elements section and select the quizzes widget:  
Before we get into the mechanics of how to build a quiz, let's take a look at the various styling elements.  
As with any of the element widgets all of the styling is pretty much the same in design. from selecting colours to fonts. Just how you would style a regular \[form\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets/forms-widget).  
Within the settings tab the feature are almost the same as setting up a regular form. The only differences are that you can:  
\* Show progress bars and tabs  
   
We will cover each in details below:  
The auto advance option enables the user to advance to the next step within your quiz flow. For example: If you have multiple questions/options that are being displayed, if the user select an option they will auto advance to the next given step in your quiz flow.  
The progress bars and tabs are optional. They display a visual element to the user to show the quiz progress and what step they are at.  
Quiz fields is the place where you add all of your quiz information, from questions to images and more.  
The quiz field settings cog as highlighted below enables you to edit the step headline and description, including styling font and colour.  
The next step is to start editing your quiz questions, simply select the edit fields tab.  
Quizzes are made up of Steps and within those steps are fields. You are not limited to the amount of steps you want to create for your quiz\!  
The image above is displaying the actual quiz field editor. As mentioned this is where you can insert all your quiz information from text to images. Let's take a look at how to edit the quiz questions first: Select the setting button as shown below, a new pop up window will display.  
Most of the settings options are for styling and display, which really depends on how you want that part of your quiz to appear to the user. The main settings to focus on are:  
\* Can select multiple options  
   
The \*\*select multiple options\*\* tab is self explanatory: Meaning if you have more than one question/option you want the user to select, then this is classed as a multiple option.  
\*\*Map to CRM Property\*\*: This is an optional, but important step if you want to save the information collected from the user and use it later on in your marketing strategy. For example you can save an answer and send it via email or even display it on the next page. So it's perfect for website personalization\!  
If the property does not exist, you can simply create one specifically for that quiz question.  
Required field: Again pretty self explanatory, meaning an option is required to be selected before the user can progress within the quiz.  
Within your quiz step you can create multiple questions per step and each question has a valued based answer, which will we cover shortly. Let's take a look at the quiz question settings first.  
Next to each question there is a little cog 'settings' as shown below  
When select a new window will appear. Within this window there are a few options:  
\* Show additional information  
   
\*\*Adding an image\*\*, some users when creating their quizzes only display images. For example let's say you have a branding quiz... You could display an four images and ask what design do they like best. So it's entirely up to your quiz design whether you use images or not. Note you can also have a combination of images and text to.  
\*\*TOP TIP\*\* \- If using images be sure to make them all the same size. As this helps keep the visual display of your quiz more attractive, rather than have mis shaped images. Although the options also allow you to have the images displayed in a square or circular design  
\*\*Show additional information:\*\* If you want to display additional information on your questions such as more info about that certain question you can. The additional info will display in an info styled icon and once selected it will display your additional info as shown below  
\*\*Skip to another step:\*\* If you want your users to skip often referred to as 'jump' to another part of your quiz, even to 3 or 4 steps ahead then this is the feature you need. Simply select where you want the user to go, once the question/option has been selected.  
\*\*Add a tag:\*\* Adding tags to your users during the process of taking the quiz can assist with deeper segmentation or keeping it simple to trigger further on automations or even email campaigns. Note: each question can have it's own tag allocated if required.  
Quizzes are designed to help you generate leads and drive users to things like recommend products and more. With the scoring element within the quiz, this will help you give the right outcome to the user.  
Each question can have it's own score allocated. But do note; not all questions require a score and can be left at 0 'zero' if required.  
As shown in the image above, each quiz question/option can have it's own score. How does the scoring work?  
So each quiz you create will have it's very own outcome. The outcome is based on a score. So for example:  
We have a quiz that asks a series of questions about branding. At the end of the quiz, the score value will be added together to show a result based on their answers.  
Let's say total score \= \*\*10\*\*, the score of ten takes them to a downloadable guide book to help with branding.  
They score \*\*20\*\*, meaning they understand branding a little more so, but need more one to one assistance. We can then send them to register for a free course.  
They score \*\*30\*\*, meaning they have a huge understanding about branding, but want to take i to another level. We can now direct them to a paid service that will help them more so.  
So once you have your scoring strategy mapped out, now is the time to manage where you want to take them once the quiz is complete.  
We have already discussed how the scoring works, so now you can insert your scoring in the score management tab. As you can see \- simply add your score result then select whether you want to send a quick thank you message containing their result, or direct them to a specific page, funnel step or even a checkout with a product that is recommended to them based on their quiz answers.  
Quizzes can also be used in pop ups to if required  
So as you can see, the quizzes are a powerful and popular feature that enables users to generate leads and make sales by using interactive quizzes, instead of the normal forms we fill out daily.

\#\# Opt in  
The opt in funnel template consists of four funnel steps:  
1, Landing page  
2, Order page  
3, Checkout 'including upsell offer'  
4, Thank you  
\#\#\#   
What is an opt in funnel?  
An opt-in funnel is a marketing strategy designed to capture leads and grow an email list. The goal of the funnel is to incentivize users to provide their email address in exchange for valuable content or offers. Here are the four steps of an opt-in funnel that consists of a landing page to capture email address, an order page, a checkout with an upsell product, and a thank you for purchasing page:  
\*\*Step 1:\*\* Landing page: The first step of the opt-in funnel is a landing page that captures the user's email address. The landing page should include a headline that promises a valuable offer or incentive in exchange for the user's email address. The page should also have a \*\*form\*\* where users can enter their email address and optionally additional information, such as their name or phone number. The form should be prominently displayed on the page and should make it clear what users will receive in exchange for their email address.  
\*\*Step 2:\*\* Order page info: Once the user submits their email address, they are directed to an order page that provides more information about the offer or incentive. This page should include details such as the price, the value proposition, and any additional benefits that come with the offer. The page should also include a prominent call-to-action that encourages users to proceed to the checkout page.  
\*\*Step 3:\*\* Checkout with upsell: The third step of the funnel is the checkout page, where users can purchase the offer or incentive. The checkout page should include a clear and concise form where users can enter their payment information. Additionally, we included an upsell product, which is a product that is complementary or an upgrade to the main offer. The upsell product should be presented as a limited-time offer and should provide significant additional value to users.  
\*\*Step 4:\*\* Thank you for purchasing page: After completing the checkout process, the user is directed to a thank you page that confirms their purchase and provides instructions on how to access the offer or incentive. The page should also express appreciation for the user's purchase and provide additional resources or recommendations for similar products or services. Overall, a well-designed opt-in funnel can help businesses grow their email lists, generate leads, and increase their revenue. By providing a clear and valuable offer, presenting additional complementary products, and expressing gratitude for the user's business, the funnel can build trust and credibility with users and ultimately convert them into loyal customers.  
The below image displays the 4 step funnel within the builder it's self. As you can see, you have a all the required steps to make it function for you.  
\*\*Note:\*\* To the right of the funnel step you will see a trophy icon. This denotes a funnel step goal. For example, Once the visitor has taken action on the landing page. They have hit a goal. You can see all goals within the funnel analytics tab.  
Below we have displayed the funnel step in full page layout.  
\* Checkout 'including upsell offer'  
   
The landing page is built using many elements, which located within the \*\*containers\*\* themselves. The main emphasis here is to generate leads. By providing enough information for them to take action and move to the next step. To capture lead information we're using the \*\*forms widget.\*\* Once the user selects the date and time they will proceed to the next step. During this process we have captured their email and add them to an \*\*email list.\*\*  
The format and layout design for the opt in funnel is broken down into multiple containers ensuring that all information is displayed correctly and most of all clear to read and understand. You will notice that in all our templates that we have added simple text to assist you what to write.  
\*\*Note:\*\* That any element of the funnel design can be fully edited to how you wish. You can also add the booking widget to the landing page if required.  
Once the visitor has clicked on any \*\*button\*\* or filled out the \*\*form widget\*\* on the landing page, the next step in the funnel is the order page where your product/s are displayed.​  
Note in this funnel we are using a button to add the product directly to the cart and takes them straight to the checkout with the item already added.  
Here we are using a simple pop up to display the \*\*checkout widget\*\*. We opted for a one step checkout process and the add to cart display. For example as mentioned above, items are automatically added to the cart once the users taps a button.  
After the purchase had been made, we are offering an upsell to another product. In this example we have bundled all 3 products together and shown at a reduced rate if purchased. Again we are using a simple popup widget to display the upsell offer.  
\*\*Note:\*\* When using the upsell option, you will notice that you can display two buttons. Yes and no. If the customer clicks yes the order is automatically processed so the customers does not need to fill in the payment details again. Helping you create simple processes.  
Depending on the type of opt in campaign you are running, will depict what type of thank you page information you'll need. In our example, the opt in funnel was to generate leads and sales and to build our \*\*email list\*\*. In this case, we notified them that we just sent an email and added a link to the \*\*cta button\*\* to get them to join our Facebook community.

\# \[Upsell & Downsell | Support Hub\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/funnels/upsell-and-downsell)

3\. \[Funnels\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/funnels)  
\#\# Upsell & Downsell  
In sales funnels, upselling and downselling are techniques used to increase revenue by offering additional products or services to a customer after they have made a purchase or declined to purchase a higher-priced item.  
\*\*Upselling\*\* normally involves offering an additional or a product that complements the original purchase, with the goal of increasing the overall sale value. For example, a customer may purchase a beginners course from you, but an upsell could be a more advanced course with better features and a higher price point. Or, maybe a complementary offer that relates to the beginners course. Such as a one-to-one coaching call or even some merch. Either way this will help increase your cart revenue.  
\*\*Downselling\*\*, on the other hand, involves offering a less expensive alternative to a customer who has declined to purchase the upsell item. For example, a customer may have declined to purchase a higher-end course, merch or one-to-one call, but a downsell could be a lower-priced product. Such as for example, a branded mug or a how to guide.  
Some key benefits of upselling and down selling in a sales funnel include:  
1\. \*\*Increased revenue:\*\* Upselling and down selling can increase the overall value of a sale, leading to more revenue for the business.  
   
2\. \*\*Improved customer satisfaction:\*\* By offering customers more options, they may be able to find a product or service that better meets their needs and preferences.  
   
3\. \*\*Increased customer loyalty:\*\* If a customer feels that a business is truly interested in helping them find the right product or service, they may be more likely to return in the future.  
   
4\. \*\*Cost-effective marketing:\*\* Upselling and down selling can be a more cost-effective way to generate revenue than acquiring new customers, since the customer has already shown interest in the business by making a purchase.  
   
5\. \*\*Increased lifetime value of customers:\*\* By offering additional products or services, businesses can increase the lifetime value of their customers by encouraging repeat purchases and building long-term relationships.  
   
To get started with creating your upsell simply navigate to the funnel step where you already have a checkout. You'll see a green bar \*\*"+Add upsell or downsell"\*\*  
Once you select the \+Add upsell or downsell" a pop up will display. From here you have 2 options:  
Depending on the type of product you want to try and upsell/downsell, will depend on which option you select. For example if you have a product that doesn't need much explaining like a branded hoodie then a pop up will suffice. But if you have more context you would like the visitor to read, or watch video explainers then a page would suit that option.  
The great thing is that if you are not sure, you can always use the A/B split testing to help you get real time data driven insights.  
For this example we will keep it simple and select the pop up option, but the same principle apply to using pages. When you select page or popup you will be shown our pre-made upsell/downsell pages and popups.  
Just like any other block or container the editing remain the same. Simply drag and drop any widget element into place.  
First off we need to add our product that we want to offer as the upsell. Navigate to the call to action button to add your product. Once selected a new op up will display. Select the Add Upsell Product \- This will open a list of all your products. Select the item you want to add.  
Once you have added your product you now have a couple more options:  
\*\*Overwriting the price\*\* will change the original store price, so you can make offers directly within the funnel only.  
Add a great call to action copy, something that will make your customers click.  
\*\*Note:\*\* It's important to note that if the customer sees your upsell/downsell, they \*\*DO NOT have to re-enter their payment details again\*\*. The product cost will be automatically taken. This helps speed up the conversions.  
\*\*Adding a decline link\*\* will allow the customer to decline the offer and move to the next step in your funnel. Note: you can also remove the decline link if required.  
And finally, you have the option to add the customer to an email list or even add a \[tag\](https://docs.blankblocks.com/blankblocks-platform/crm/crm-tags) to help segment those who have purchased the upsell offer. Great for retargeting those who didn't purchase.  
Once you have created your upsell, you will now see it within the funnel steps as shown below.  
Adding a downsell is exactly the same process as creating an upsell. Once created it will be added below the upsell step in the funnel as shown below.  
\*\*Note:\*\* You do have the option to create unlimited upsells and downsells within a funnel.  
The number of upsells and downsells in a sales funnel can vary depending on the specific business and product or service being sold. There isn't necessarily a right or wrong answer for how many upsells and downsells to include in a funnel, but it's generally a good idea to keep the number of offers reasonable and \*\*not overwhelm the customer with too many choices\*\*.  
In general, a good rule of thumb is to limit the number of upsells and downsells to no more than three or four. This allows you to offer additional products or services without making the customer feel overwhelmed or pressured to make too many decisions.  
It's also important to make sure that each upsell and downsell offer is relevant and valuable to the customer, and not just an attempt to make more sales. By focusing on providing real value and meeting the customer's needs, businesses can build trust and loyalty and increase the chances of future sales.​  
1\. Navigate to the funnel step where you already have a checkout and select "+Add upsell or downsell".  
   
2\. Choose between a page or a popup, depending on the type of product you want to offer.  
   
3\. Select the pre-made upsell/downsell page or popup that you want to use.  
   
4\. Edit the upsell by adding your product and customizing the call-to-action button, including changing the price, adding a decline link, and adding the customer to an email list or segment.  
   
5\. Save your upsell and it will appear within the funnel steps.  
   
And here are the steps for creating a downsell in a sales funnel:  
1\. Follow the same steps as creating an upsell, but select "Add downsell" instead of "Add upsell".  
   
2\. Customize the downsell offer and call-to-action button.  
   
3\. Save your downsell and it will appear below the upsell step in the funnel.

For example, create a form on your website where customers can request their data.  
When a customer requests their data, you should give them a copy of all the personal data that you have. This can be data stored in different locations (like your autoresponders, information in CRMs, or data in our platform).  
To request the available personal data that is stored on our servers.  
Go to Website \*\*Settings\*\* \> \*\*Cookies & Privacy\*\* \> \*\*Request Customer Data\*\* at the very bottom. Within 72 hours we will provide you with all the data that we have for the specific customer (identified by email) on your website.

You will need to set up a Twilio account to use this feature. Click \[here\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/internal-integrations/twilio\#what-is-twilio) to read more about setting up your Twilio integration to send SMS and WhatsApp messages.  
\[Twilio\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/internal-integrations/twilio)  
Once you have connected and set up your Twilio account we'll show you how to:  
\* Connect Twilio to your projects  
   
\* Use messaging with Automations  
   
Plus, why SMS is such an effective marketing tool and how to use it best.  
\#\#   
\*\*Setting up your Twilio Integration\*\*  
Head to your website builder dashboard and navigate to the \*\*settings cog\*\*. Select \*\*Applications\*\*, then \*\*add application\*\* and scroll down until you see the \*\*Twilio integration\*\* tab.  
\#\#\#   
Configure the Twilio Settings  
Upon setting up your Twilio connection, within the Twilio dashboard you may of noticed some ID's etc. You now need to add these credentials to the Twilio application settings below.  
Here is where you can find the Twilio credentials required. Simply copy and paste the:  
If you want to send bulk SMS and WhatsApp messages you will need to add in your Messaging Services ID.  
Read more about Messaging Services \[Here\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/internal-integrations/twilio\#creating-a-service)  
Great you're all set up and ready to start sending messages to your customers.  
To send messages to your customers, you can do so by either sending individual messages or sending in bulk via campaigns and your automation flows.  
To send individual messages to your customers it works pretty much the same way the \[individual email\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/individual-email-sending\#create-and-send-an-individual-email-to-a-single-contact-from-the-contacts-profile-in-the-crm) does. First head over to your \[\*\*Contacts\*\*\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/crm) tab and select a customer you want to send a message to.  
Note: You can only send messages to customers who are actively subscribed to email.  
To determine if the customer is subscribed, look for a small check icon in the profile image at the top. If this icon is green, the customer is subscribed. You can also manually subscribe them if needed by clicking on the three dots and selecting '\*\*Subscribe\*\*.'  
Select the messaging channel you want to use to send the message:  
Both SMS and WhatsApp are similar in setup, but they differ when it comes to sending messages. WhatsApp requires you to use message templates and tags to comply with their messaging policy. First, let's send an SMS message.  
When sending an SMS you can \*\*add tags\*\*, \*\*send\*\* \*\*test\*\*, and \*\*schedule\*\*  
\*\*Add tag\*\*: Help keep the message personalized to your customer. When selecting the Add tag button a new window will display, this is where you can use the CRM properties.  
To send a WhatsApp message to your customers, navigate to the \*\*Contacts\*\* tab and select the contact you want to message. You will now see the customer's individual profile displayed. Click the \*\*message icon\*\* and select '\*\*Send WhatsApp'\*\*.  
Just like sending an SMS, you can also \*\*send an attachment\*\* (Image file) with a WhatsApp message. You’ll also notice a new button displayed: '\*\*Submit Message for Approval\*\*.' Once you have finished writing your message, you will need to send it to WhatsApp as a template for verification, which only takes a few seconds. \*\*Note\*\*: It can sometimes take a little longer, but this is out of our hands, as it’s controlled by WhatsApp.  
When you click the 'Submit Message for Approval' button a new window will display. In this window you will need to add some details.  
Make sure the name you choose is descriptive enough to convey the purpose of the template but also concise. This will help you easily identify the template when you need to use it later.  
The two categories, \*\*Utility\*\* and \*\*Marketing\*\*, are designed to classify the type of messages you send via WhatsApp templates. Each category serves a different purpose, and it’s important to choose the right one based on the content of your message.  
\*\*Summary\*\*  
\* \*\*Utility\*\*: Use for essential, transactional, or account-related messages. It’s about delivering necessary information.  
   
\* \*\*Marketing\*\*: Use for promotional and engagement messages aimed at driving sales or customer interaction.  
   
Choosing the correct category is important to comply with WhatsApp’s policies and to ensure your messages are effectively received by your audience.  
Once you have sent a message and had your message/template verified, you will be able to use it again or create new templates for different types of messages, whether they are for utility or marketing.  
To \*\*reuse a WhatsApp messaging template\*\*, simply go to '\*\*Send WhatsApp Message\*\*,' and in the messaging window, you will see a new tab and options at the top.  
Not only can you send individual messages to your customers, but you can also unleash the power of mass messaging—just like sending an engaging email campaign\! Reach a wider audience and make your communication more impactful\!  
Navigate to the \[Email and Automations\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows) tab, select '\*\*Campaigns\*\*,' and then click on 'Create New.'  
Next, you'll need to select the campaign type; in this instance, we will be sending a message, not an email.  
Select the channel or type of message you want to send:  
Once selected chose what list/audience you want to send it to.  
Just like setting up an \[individual message\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/sms-and-whatsapp\#individual-messaging) for a customer, the process is exactly the same when creating a bulk message campaign.  
Once you have created the message you want to send to a selected audience/list you can now go ahead and send or schedule.  
Just like creating an \[email automation\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows) campaign, you can supercharge your workflows by adding SMS, WhatsApp, and even voice messaging into the mix\! Expand your reach and engage your audience across multiple channels effortlessly.  
Create a new automation flow or add to an existing one. You'll be able to add the messaging components at any stage in your automation flow.  
To add a message in to the flow, select where you want to add it. Then select the messaging channel you want to use.  
Once you have selected the messaging channel, you can \*\*create a new message\*\*, or if using WhatsApp, you’ll be able to use any saved \[templates\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/messaging-and-workflows/sms-and-whatsapp\#whatsapp-templates) you’ve created before.

\#\# Email Account Review  
\#\#\#   
\*\*Why we review Email Accounts?\*\*  
To maintain great deliverability for your emails, we review and score accounts based on their sending history. That's why we have two main reasons for putting your account in a review mode:  
\*\*Sending allowance\*\* \- to create a score for new users, we need to collect some sending data. All new senders start with a limit of 1000 emails, to begin with. This gives us enough data and time to see the bounce and spam rates for that account. After we generate a score, we will extend your allowance to send more emails. This process usually takes no more than 2 hours and it is automatic. Review of your account will start at about 80% of the allowance limit.  
\*\*The allowance limits are\*\*: 1,000 / 5,000 / 10,000 / 25,000 / Unlimited.  
\*\*Bad reputation\*\* \\- If your score is low, the platform will automatically add your account on pause and pending approval or decline from an admin. Bad reputation is generated due to bad bounce or spam rates. Our accepted rates are 5% bounce rate and 0.1% spam rate. If either of these is above, your account will be paused for review.  
\*\*Issues with links\*\* \- If your links are leading to content that is not compliant with our terms and conditions, we will put your account under review from an admin. Other reasons are if you use link shorteners, multiple redirects, etc.  
\*\*Billing issues\*\* \- If we see a chargeback and dispute of a payment, we will put your account in review.  
Most reviews are automatic and you will be notified via email when you are able to start sending emails again. You can also start sending emails once the warning message is removed from your Email Marketing section.  
If we need more information from you, we will let you know.

3\. \[Funnels\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/funnels)  
\#\# Funnel orientation  
Funnels are designed for two main outcomes \- Generating sales and leads.  
When it comes to designing your funnels, easy to create, edit and manage all in one place. Let's take a look at the funnels main editor dashboard:  
We can break the dashboard down in to two main areas:  
Your funnels are broken down in to 'Step' Each funnel has the flexibility of having UNLIMITED Funnel steps.  
Funnels steps consist of individual pages, popups, checkouts and more. In the image below we have three steps:  
Options within the funnel setting: Within each funnel step there are additional settings.  
\* \*\*Remove/Add Goal:\*\* Adding a goal to a funnel step enables you to collect insights about how a user moves through your funnels steps. For example when a user completes a form or purchases an item we can mark this as a Goal. Goals are identified by a trophy icon to right hand side.  
   
\* \*\*Show settings:\*\* This option enables you to change the step name, URL, SEO and also step security. For example you may have steps in your funnel that only allows access to certain members. Here is where you set that up.  
   
\* \*\*Duplicate:\*\* To save time, you can simply duplicate the entire step and use it somewhere else in the funnel.  
   
\* \*\*Copy to another funnel:\*\* If you want to copy a specific funnel step to an entirely different funnel. Helps speed up your design process.  
   
\* \*\*Delete:\*\* This will delete the funnel step selected.  
   
\*\*Moving your funnel steps:\*\* If you need to change the order of any step. Simply hover over the step you want to move up or down and drag to the desired place as shown below:  
\*\*Note:\*\* When moving the funnel steps the numbers will change also. For example in the image below we are moving step one to the position of step two. Once moved the number will change so the numbers remain in sequence.  
If you need to add additional steps to your funnel, maybe you have multiple course modules, multi product stores or just need a step separator then select the add new step button. A new window will display:  
\* \*\*Page:\*\* Add a new page and select a pre-made page theme from the library  
   
\* \*\*Popup:\*\* Commonly used for checkouts and opt in forms. But you can add anything to them  
   
\* \*\*Section label:\*\* Section label are a great way to make separations between funnel step for example: If you have multiple steps like sales pages, or course modules. Section label help you keep it nice and organised.  
   
\*\*Section labels\*\* can be moved up and down the funnel to your preferred spot.  
Firstly we will cover the actual funnel step analytics as there are more areas you can view for more funnel data.  
Once your funnel is live, you can monitor its performance as users navigate through, view sales pages, and make purchases. All the relevant data will be available in one centralized location.  
Each funnel step has it's own data, this can be view by tapping the little numbered % icon. once selected it will open a new drop down displaying the funnel step data.  
Here's what it would look like when people start moving though your funnel steps: As you can see the number of visitors and conversions this specific step has.

\#\# Countdown  
Countdown timers do a whole lot more than just tick away\!  
Our countdown timers are very dynamic and can really put real time scarcity into your promotions and offers to automatically switching pages when offers expire and more.  
When selecting the Edit tab a new window will pop out. Here are shown three option tabs:  
First let's take a look at the Countdown type options:  
\* \*\*Count to date:\*\* Let's take for example you have an offer page that displays a limited time offer, here you add the time when the offer runs out by selecting the date and time you prefer.  
   
\*\*Count time\*\*: Just like the count to date option the count time works on the same principle but instead of a date it works based on a time period amount. Let's take for example you have offer that closes in 24 hours, the timer will start counting down that time. Note: You have the option to reset the time when a user re-visits the page. But if you want to keep a global countdown, meaning if they return later on the offer time has decreased.  
\*\*Count number:\*\* The count number option allows you to add a starting number and an end number. Further to that you can set the interval to change periodically  
And finally the most important part of the countdown widget. When you have set your timer using one of the options. What do you want to happen when the timer reaches zero or if using count number, what do you want to happen when that number is reached.  
You have three options:  
Each one of which has there own strategy. For example let's say you have a promotional offer on your landing page, and doors close next week at midday. For those who miss the promotional window you could show them a simple wait list page. This is a great option if your offer is closed but you want to build a list of people who want the offer next time you promote it, or you could send an automated email that still sells them the product/service but maybe with a different offer or no offer at all.  
And as always you can edit the styling to match your brand

Whether you're building a blog, a portfolio, or a business site, our blocks are designed to cater to various styles and needs.  
To add a new block to your page, navigate to the top or bottom of any container as shown below.  
Once you select the block tab, you'll see a gallery of pre-designed blocks. Choose the one you like, and it will be added to your page for editing.  
Your block has been added to the page and is now ready for editing.  
You can also save your block design for future use or for another project.  
Go to the top of the block and select "Copy Widget":  
After selecting the copy widget, your copied block will appear under the saved blocks icon.

Note: You do not have to use images. If you simply want text or even video then that is also possible.  
So select the layer you want to add in this example we will use an image layer.  
Great we have added an image layer. Also note that if you don't want to add an image as a layer you can set the image as a background by selecting the Change image button at the top of the editor.  
Ok, so now we have added our image layer we can now modify it more if required. From setting the animation to adding a URL link to the image.  
Next I want to add some text to the image, to do so: simply create a new layer and select text layer.  
A new editing box has been displayed. Simply type in the text your want to add as a new layer. Set the font styling \- colour and also animation and it's ready.

1\. \[Platform\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform)  
3\. \[Widgets\](https://https://docs.bosscart.io/hc/platform/widgets)  
\#\# Container widget  
The container widget enables you to add additional widgets in to a specific container or also known as a block.  
Adding a \*\*container widget\*\* to your website. To add a container go to \> \*\*Widgets\*\* and \*\*select container\*\*  
Once your container is set up, there are many settings available to help you create and design the perfect section for your page.  
Let's take a look closer at the \*\*container settings\*\*.  
Below you will see:  
Within a container you can edit:  
Before we get in to the finer details let's take a look at the main container elements.  
Like any container/block you can make divisions and create multiple horizontal columns and also vertical columns. The image below shows the container/block being split into 3 horizontal columns.  
To split the container into up to 5 columns, hover your mouse at the top of the selected container or block. A button will appear to perform the split.  
Note: Each column can be resized to the width you require. Additionally you can also add borders and different colours to each column.  
In the image below we have added a colour to the columns so you can see visually what we mean.  
Before we progress on how to use columns for your content, let's discuss creating vertical columns. You can add a new column either above or below the existing three columns. Click the plus (+) icon to add a new column above, for example.  
We have added a new row above the previous one. This row has two columns: white and black for reference.  
Now we have one container with:  
Global columns streamline your design process by allowing you to use the same block on multiple pages. With the global column setting, you can update one location, and the changes will automatically apply to all columns sharing the same global column information.  
To create a global column, first select the desired column. Then, navigate to the settings pop-out and select 'This is a global column'.  
After selection, a drop-down menu will appear. For first-time users, only one option will be available, as illustrated below:  
After selecting the option, name your column and click save. Now, your column is global. This means that if you copy and paste this column to multiple pages on your website, any edits made will reflect on all instances of the global column.  
The image below shows the column we converted into a global column. No other columns will be affected.  
To remove or rename a column, either deselect the option or click on the rename text.  
\*\*Anchor points\*\* are specific sections of your website that you direct visitors to when they click on a call-to-action button or a link within the text.  
If you have a button on your website that you want visitors to click, you can link it to a specific section on the same page. When clicked, it will take users directly to the section where the \*\*anchor point\*\* is placed.  
\*\*How to add an anchor point:\*\*  
1\. Navigate to \*\*Container Settings\*\*.  
   
3\. Label your anchor point for future reference.  
   
4\. Add the anchor point link to the call to action (e.g., a button).  
   
Adding your anchor point from your call to action  
Select your originating call to action. In this case we will use a button.  
Select the anchor point, then choose the page, section, or funnel step where your anchor point is located. It will have the same label you assigned earlier.  
Note you can have different anchor points across different devices 'Mobile and desktop' if required.  
Make sure you have saved your anchor point if it does not appear in the drop-down menu. Once saved, it will be listed.  
\#\#\#   
\*\*Container additional settings\*\*  
Within the container you can control:  
\* Hide/make container draft  
   
\* Block/container positioning  
   
\*\*Container Delay\*\* functions just like any widget delay: You can choose a specific time frame for the whole container to appear when a visitor views your website.  
\*\*Hiding\*\* or marking a container as a draft will make it invisible to website visitors.  
Finally, \*\*block/container positioning\*\* allows you to quickly move your containers up and down the page.
